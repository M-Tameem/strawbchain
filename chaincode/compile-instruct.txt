Module Name:

The chaincode module name is currently set to foodtrace.
You generally do not need to change this â€” it is never exposed to end-users (including in development).

If you do need to change it (e.g. re-naming the repo/module):

Replace import "foodtrace" at the top of all .go files with the new path.
Update all foodtrace/... references to match the new path.
Update the module line in main.go.

Building for Kaleido:
From the chaincode directory, run:

GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o foodtrace.bin

foodtrace.bin can be renamed to any filename; the name has no effect in production.
